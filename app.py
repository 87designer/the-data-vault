## 🚀 About This Project
The Data Vault is my **self-built, interactive tech portfolio**, designed to **showcase my expertise** in data science development, data engineering, and data visualization.

Every component of this application has been **individually crafted**, from the **frontend interface** in Streamlit to the **backend services** powered by FastAPI, LangChain, and database integrations. This project is more than just a resume—it's a **technical demonstration of my skills in real-world application development**.

## 🎯 Why This Matters
Rather than a static resume, this project provides a **live demonstration** of my **technical ability**, engineering mindset, and problem-solving skills. You can interact with my experience visually, explore my skills dynamically, and even **query my resume** and chat with my experience using an AI-powered interface.

## 📌 How I'm Tracking Progress
This project follows an organized development lifecycle:
- **🔄 Version Control:** Managed with GitHub for tracking changes & iterations.
- **📋 Milestones & Issues:** Each feature is documented & tracked using **GitHub Issues & Milestones**.
- **🛠️ Agile Development:** Continuous improvements based on structured phases.

You can explore the full **development history, commits, and planned milestones** in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/87designer/the-data-vault).
